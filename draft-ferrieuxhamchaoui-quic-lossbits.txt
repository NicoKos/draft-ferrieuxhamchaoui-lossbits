             Packet Loss Signaling for Encrypted Protocols
              draft-ferrieuxhamchaoui-quic-lossbits-latest

Abstract

   This draft adapts the general technique described in draft-
   ferrieuxhamchaoui-tsvwg-lossbits for QUIC using reserved bits in QUIC
   v1 short header.  It describes a method that employs two bits to
   allow endpoints to signal packet loss in a way that can be used by
   network devices to measure and locate the source of the loss.  A
   companion draft, draft-ferrieuxhamchaoui-tsvwg-lossbits-extension,
   describes negotiating this functionality as an extension in QUIC v1.

1.  Introduction

   Packet loss is a hard and pervasive problem of day-to-day network
   operation, and proactively detecting, measuring, and locating it is
   crucial to maintaining high QoS and timely resolution of crippling
   end-to-end throughput issues.  To this effect, in a TCP-dominated
   world, network operators have been heavily relying on information
   present in the clear in TCP headers: sequence and acknowledgment
   numbers, and SACK when enabled.  These allow for quantitative
   estimation of packet loss by passive on-path observation.
   Additionally, the lossy segment (upstream or downstream from the
   observation point) can be quickly identified by moving the passive
   observer around.

   With QUIC, the equivalent transport headers are encrypted and passive
   packet loss observation is not possible, as described in
   [TRANSPORT-ENCRYPT].

   QUIC could be routed by the network differently and the fraction of
   Internet traffic delivered using QUIC is increasing every year.
   Therefore, is it imperative to measure packet loss experienced by
   QUIC users directly instead of relying on measuring TCP loss between
   similar endpoints.

   Since explicit path signals are preferred by [RFC8558], two explicit
   loss bits in the clear portion of short headers are used to signal
   packet loss to on-path network devices.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Loss Bits

   The proposal introduces two bits that are to be present in packets
   with a short header.  Therefore, only loss of short header packets is
   reported using loss bits.  Whenever this specification refers to
   packets, it is referring only to packets with short headers.

   *  Q: The "sQuare signal" bit is toggled every N outgoing packets as
      explained below in Section 3.1.

   *  L: The "Loss event" bit is set to 0 or 1 according to the
      Unreported Loss counter, as explained below in Section 3.2.

   Each endpoint maintains appropriate counters independently and
   separately for each connection 4-tuple and destination Connection ID.

3.1.  Setting the sQuare Bit on Outgoing Packets

   The sQuare Value is initialized to the Initial Q Value (0 or 1) and
   is reflected in the Q bit of every outgoing packet.  The sQuare value
   is inverted after sending every N packets (a Q run).  Hence, Q Period
   is 2*N.  The Q bit represents "packet color" as defined by [RFC8321].

   Observation points can estimate the upstream losses by counting the
   number of packets during a half period of the square signal, as
   described in Section 4.

3.1.1.  Q Run Length Selection

   The sender is expected to choose Q run length based on the expected
   amount of loss and reordering on the path (see Section 4.2).  The Q
   run length MUST be at least 64 and be a power of 2.  This requirement
   allows an Observer to infer the Q run length by obsering one period
   of the square signal.  It also allows the Observer to identify flows
   that set the loss bits to arbitrary values (see Section 5).

   If the sender does not have sufficient information to make an
   informed decision about Q run length, the sender SHOULD use Q run of
   64 packets.  Alternatively, the sender MAY also choose a random Q run
   length for each connection, increasing the chances of using a Q run
   length that gives the best signal for some connections.

3.2.  Setting the Loss Event Bit on Outgoing Packets

   The Unreported Loss counter is initialized to 0, and the L bit of
   every outgoing packet indicates whether the Unreported Loss counter
   is positive (L=1 if the counter is positive, and L=0 otherwise).  The
   value of the Unreported Loss counter is decremented every time a
   packet with L=1 is sent.

   The value of the Unreported Loss counter is incremented for every
   packet that the protocol declares lost, using QUIC's existing loss
   detection machinery.  If the implementation is able to rescind the
   loss determination later, a positive Unreported Loss counter MAY be
   decremented due to the rescission, but it SHOULD NOT become negative.

   This loss signaling is similar to loss signaling in [RFC7713], except
   the Loss Event bit is reporting the exact number of lost packets,
   whereas Echo Loss bit in [RFC7713] is reporting an approximate number
   of lost bytes.

   Observation points can estimate the end-to-end loss, as determined by
   the upstream endpoint's loss detection machinery, by counting packets
   in this direction with a L bit equal to 1, as described in Section 4.

4.  Using the Loss Bits for Passive Loss Measurement

   There are three sources of observable loss:

   *  _upstream loss_ - loss between the sender and the observation
      point (Section 4.2)

   *  _downstream loss_ - loss between the observation point and the
      destination (Section 4.4)

Internet-Draft                  loss-bits                   January 2020


   *  _observer loss_ - loss by the observer itself that does not cause
      downstream loss (Section 4.5)

   The upstream and downstream loss together constitute _end-to-end
   loss_ (Section 4.1).

   The Q and L bits allow detection and measurement of the types of loss
   listed above.

4.1.  End-To-End Loss

   The Loss Event bit allows an observer to calculate the end-to-end
   loss rate by counting packets with L bit value of 0 and 1 for a given
   connection.  The end-to-end loss rate is the fraction of packets with
   L=1.

   The simplifying assumption here is that upstream loss affects packets
   with L=0 and L=1 equally.  This may be a simplification, if some loss
   is caused by tail-drop in a network device.  If the sender congestion
   controller reduces the packet send rate after loss, there may be a
   sufficient delay before sending packets with L=1 that they have a
   greater chance of arriving at the observer.

4.2.  Upstream Loss

   Blocks of N (half of Q Period) consecutive packets are sent with the
   same value of the Q bit, followed by another block of N packets with
   inverted value of the Q bit.  Hence, knowing the value of N, an on-
   path observer can estimate the amount of loss after observing at
   least N packets.  The upstream loss rate is one minus the average
   number of packets in a block of packets with the same Q value divided
   by N.

   The observer needs to be able to tolerate packet reordering that can
   blur the edges of the square signal.

   The observer also needs to differentiate packets as belonging to
   different connections, since they use independent counters.

   The choice of N strikes a compromise: the observation could become
   too unreliable in case of packet reordering and loss if N is too
   small; and when N is too large, short connections may not yield a
   useful upstream loss measurement.

   To leave some room for adaptation, we only constrain the sender to
   select an N that is (1) constant for a given connection and (2) equal
   to a power of two.  The latter allows on-path observers to derive N
   after a few periods.  It is thus also acceptable for a simple

   implementation to choose a global constant; N=64 has been extensively
   tried in large-scale field tests and yielded good results.

4.3.  Correlating End-to-End and Upstream Loss

   Upstream loss is calculated by observing the actual packets that did
   not suffer the upstream loss.  End-to-end loss, however, is
   calculated by observing subsequent packets after the sender's
   protocol detected the loss.  Hence, end-to-end loss is generally
   observed with a delay of between 1 RTT (loss declared due to multiple
   duplicate acknowledgments) and 1 RTO (loss declared due to a timeout)
   relative to the upstream loss.

   The connection RTT can sometimes be estimated by timing protocol
   handshake messages.  This RTT estimate can be greatly improved by
   observing a dedicated protocol mechanism for conveying RTT
   information, such as the Latency Spin bit of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   Whenever the observer needs to perform a computation that uses both
   upstream and end-to-end loss rate measurements, it SHOULD use
   upstream loss rate leading the end-to-end loss rate by approximately
   1 RTT.  If the observer is unable to estimate RTT of the connection,
   it should accumulate loss measurements over time periods of at least
   4 times the typical RTT for the observed connections.

   If the calculated upstream loss rate exceeds the end-to-end loss rate
   calculated in Section 4.1, then either the Q Period is too short for
   the amount of packet reordering or there is observer loss, described
   in Section 4.5.  If this happens, the observer SHOULD adjust the
   calculated upstream loss rate to match end-to-end loss rate.

4.4.  Downstream Loss

   Because downstream loss affects only those packets that did not
   suffer upstream loss, the end-to-end loss rate ("e") relates to the
   upstream loss rate ("u") and downstream loss rate ("d") as
   "(1-u)(1-d)=1-e".  Hence, "d=(e-u)/(1-u)".

4.5.  Observer Loss

   A typical deployment of a passive observation system includes a
   network tap device that mirrors network packets of interest to a
   device that performs analysis and measurement on the mirrored
   packets.  The observer loss is the loss that occurs on the mirror
   path.

   Observer loss affects upstream loss rate measurement since it causes
   the observer to account for fewer packets in a block of identical Q



Ferrieux, et al.           Expires 8 July 2020                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  loss-bits                   January 2020


   bit values (see {{upstreamloss)}).  The end-to-end loss rate
   measurement, however, is unaffected by the observer loss, since it is
   a measurement of the fraction of packets with the set L bit value,
   and the observer loss would affect all packets equally (see
   Section 4.1).

   The need to adjust the upstream loss rate down to match end-to-end
   loss rate as described in Section 4.3 is a strong indication of the
   observer loss, whose magnitude is between the amount of such
   adjustment and the entirety of the upstream loss measured in
   Section 4.2.

5.  Ossification Considerations

   Accurate loss information is not critical to the operation of any
   protocol, though its presence for a sufficient number of connections
   is important for the operation of the networks.

   The loss bits are amenable to "greasing" described in [GREASE], if
   the protocol designers are not ready to dedicate (and ossify) bits
   used for loss reporting to this function.  The greasing could be
   accomplished similarly to the Latency Spin bit greasing in
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  Namely, implementations could decide that a
   fraction of connections should not encode loss information in the
   loss bits and, instead, the bits would be set to arbitrary values.
   The observers would need to be ready to ignore connections with loss
   information more resembling noise than the expected signal.

6.  Security Considerations

   Passive loss observation has been a part of the network operations
   for a long time, so exposing loss information to the network does not
   add new security concerns.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   Guarding user's privacy is an important goal for modern protocols and
   protocol extensions per [RFC7258].  While an explicit loss signal - a
   preferred way to share loss information per [RFC8558] - helps to
   minimize unintentional exposure of additional information,
   implementations of loss reporting must ensure that loss information
   does not compromise protocol's privacy goals.

   For example, [QUIC-TRANSPORT] allows changing Connection IDs in the
   middle of a connection to reduce the likelihood of a passive observer
   linking old and new subflows to the same device.  A QUIC
   implementation would need to reset all counters when it changes
   Connection ID used for outgoing packets.  It would also need to avoid
